I am currently working as a research engineer on the [Graphics Team](https://research.cyberagent.ai/research/computer-graphics/) at [CyberAgent AI Lab](https://cyberagent.ai/ailab/).

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in 2024 from the University of Tsukuba under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. [Satoshi Iizuka](http://iizuka.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/index_eng.html) and Prof. [Kazuhiro Fukui](http://www.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~kfukui/english/indexE.html).

My research interests span image and video editing and generation, computer graphics, and computer vision.
